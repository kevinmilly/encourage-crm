<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  <img src="readme-assets/splash.PNG" alt="splash">
  
  CRMs help many businesses track their contacts to manage leads and current clients.  That's because they effectively offer visibility on a large and small scale.  Just like     CRMs help companies towards their goal of profit; I wanted to work on a Personal CRM, with the goal of encouragement and relationship maximization.  
  
  Personal CRMS aren't new however, I wanted to really focus on assisting the user through more actionable metrics.  The CRM would be more than just a database of contacts, but   it would emulate a business-oriented CRM; giving molding data into information that you can make decisions from.  These decisions could help you enrich your network and      identify relationships that may need some work.
  
  

#### View all your contacts

You can view all the contacts holistically on the table view.
Sort or filter by the different factors that you have used to categorize your contacts.

#### Concept Detail

Drill down into a contact to see their related notes and tasks; including some additional personalized information.

#### Tasks and Notes
